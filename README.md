This repository contains a minimal example of a simple game framework written in Python. It demonstrates spawning AI factions on a map after the player places the initial settlement and clicks "Begin".

## Running the example

```
python -m game.game
```

The number of AI factions and map size are configurable in `game/settings.py`.
