# Projects

This repository contains small prototype scripts. The `ui` folder holds a simple
"Faction Creation" window for experimenting with UI components.

## Usage

Run the script to open the faction creation window:

```bash
python ui/faction_creation.py
```

Select a name, choose a color, pick a race and press **Confirm** to print the
chosen values to the console.
