# Python Strategy Game Prototypes

This repository contains modular prototypes for a turn-based strategy game. It includes:

- A **Faction Creation UI** to let players customize their faction
- A **Defense Building Selection UI** to pick starting structures
- A **Map Viewer** for exploring generated worlds
- A **Procedural World Generator** using hex tiles
- A **Game Runtime Module** that spawns AI factions after the player starts the game

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/dearpygui) for all GUI windows
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for running the test suite

Install the Python packages with:

```bash
pip install dearpygui pytest
```

## 1. Faction Creation UI

A simple GUI for experimenting with player faction creation.

**Location:** `ui/faction_creation.py`

### How to Run

```bash
python ui/faction_creation.py
```

## 2. Defense Building Selection UI

Choose which defensive structures your settlement will start with.

**Location:** `ui/defense_building_ui.py`

### How to Run

```bash
python ui/defense_building_ui.py
```

## 3. Map Viewer

View a generated world map and select a hex tile using mouse controls.

**Location:** `ui/map_view.py`

### How to Run

```bash
python ui/map_view.py
```

## 4. Random Event System

The `game.events` module provides a lightweight framework for triggering
random events such as floods, droughts or raids during gameplay. Each
event affects a settlement's resources, population and buildings.
Probabilities are influenced by configurable event weights and the
world's weather settings, allowing different worlds to feel unique.

Example usage:

```python
from world.world import WorldSettings
from game.events import EventSystem, SettlementState

settings = WorldSettings()
events = EventSystem(settings, event_weights={"flood": 1.0, "drought": 1.0, "raid": 0.5})
state = SettlementState()

# Advance turns and print triggered events
for _ in range(10):
    event = events.advance_turn(state)
    if event:
        print("Triggered", event.name)
```

## Running the Game

Launch the main prototype loop with:

```bash
python main.py
```

This loads `save.json` if it exists, applying any resource gains that would have
accumulated while the game was not running. Pass `--save-file <path>` to write
the session's progress to a custom location.

## Worker Assignment Efficiency

Factions can either rely on automated worker assignment or manually place
workers each tick. Automated assignment gathers resources at reduced efficiency
(80% of what manual placement would yield). Use the MapView worker dialog or set
`manual_assignment` on your faction to take full control.

## Saving Progress

Saving Progress
Call game.save() from your own scripts to persist the current state. By default, the data is written to save.json. 
You can optionally pass a file path to game.save(path) to write to a custom location. 
Similarly, load_state(path) will restore the game state from that file and apply offline progress based on the timestamp stored in it.

## Recommended World Sizes

World generation is chunk-based. For good performance, keep finite maps under
about **100Ã—100** tiles. When using infinite mode, limit `max_active_chunks`
to roughly **100** so river generation and caching remain fast.

## Running Tests

Execute the unit tests with:

```bash
pytest
```
