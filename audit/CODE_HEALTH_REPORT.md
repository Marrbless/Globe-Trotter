# Code Health Report - 2024-06-16

## Overview
- Project is a turn-based strategy game with world generation, resources, diplomacy, UI using DearPyGui.
- Contains ~8.4k lines of Python code. `world/world.py` and `game/game.py` are the largest modules.

## Test Results
- `pytest` => **29 failed**, 51 passed.
- Failures mostly due to missing methods (`available_powers`, `use_power`) and missing Hex attributes (`river`, `lake`, `flooded`).

## Lint Results (ruff)
- 777 violations reported (E402 import order, unused imports, etc.).

## Security Scan (bandit)
- 194 Low, 3 Medium issues. Example: use of insecure `random` for security-sensitive logic in `game/ai.py:78`.

## Complexity (radon)
- Average complexity grade A (3.88) across 398 blocks.

## Observations
- Code uses dataclasses heavily but some attributes are added dynamically (e.g., `Hex.lake`). Tests assume these exist by default, causing `AttributeError`.
- Game logic lacks implementations for god power mechanics (`available_powers`, `use_power`), causing tests to fail.
- Many modules miss docstrings and type hints are partial.
- Persistence module >600 LOC may benefit from splitting.

=======
# Code Health Report

## Architecture / Layering
- Modules split into `game`, `ui`, and `world` packages.
- Strong coupling between world tiles and events; `Hex` dataclass recently refactored but tests expect older API.
- Persistence code uses pickle for world chunks and JSON for game state.
- UI modules depend on dearpygui, not available in CI causing type errors.

## Complexity Hot Spots
- `world/world.py` has 704 statements with average complexity `A` but many functions >100 lines.
- `game/game.py` is 478 statements, 69% coverage, with several large methods causing mypy errors.

## Test Coverage
- Overall coverage 68%.
- Low coverage modules: `main.py`, UI modules, and parts of `world/world.py` and `game/persistence.py`.

## Security Review
- `pickle` used for chunk caching (B301) – risky if files untrusted.
- Temporary files in `/tmp` (B108).
- Many uses of `random.Random` flagged (B311) but acceptable for non‑crypto use.
- No secrets detected.

## Performance Notes
- Perlin noise functions cached with LRU; water feature generation may be heavy but lazily evaluated.
- Disk serialization to `/tmp` per chunk may become bottleneck.

## Lint & Static Analysis
- `ruff` passes.
- `mypy` reports 78 errors, mostly missing attributes and stub packages.
- `bandit` reports 194 low‑severity, 3 medium issues.

## Prioritized Findings
- **P1** failing tests due to outdated API in `Hex` and missing `Game` methods.
- **P1** `pickle` usage for world chunks without validation (security risk).
- **P2** `mypy` errors across modules due to missing type definitions and libs.
- **P3** low test coverage on UI and main entry point.
